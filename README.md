# QuizAssignmentDT2
 my plan is to create a command line quiz that can use a JSON files to produce a the questions and answers. inside the json file there will be a dictionary of questions and answers. the program will read the file and will be able to use it to produce a quiz. the quiz will be about the names of famous people. the user will answer by writing the name of the person. yu will be give a description of the person. i also hope to at some point advance it from a command line app to a ui based app.
